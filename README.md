## Research Experience: 
**Effects of Emotion Regulation on Creativity:** _(Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2021)_

Supervised by Professor Christopher Bauman @UCIrvine

1.  Organized the data collection of judges ‘rating sheets for 50+ new entrepreneurs from the New Venture Competition at the Paul Merage School of Business.
2.  Restructured the data with a new template for analysis to provide an accurate and clean dataset.
3.  Examined the usefulness and consistency of the dataset and re-categorized the data into new structures.

**Emotionality Analytics:** _(Jun. 2020 – Jun. 2021)_

Supervised by Professor Christopher Bauman @UCIrvine

1.  Scored and examined 300+ participants’ novelty and usefulness on their solutions to address an issue related to bankruptcy due to mismanagement and poor-quality food of a cafeteria.
2.  Categorized ideas generated by participants to facilitate analysis of causal relationships among novelty,usefulness, and cognitive flexibility.
3.  Implemented a Python program to facilitate the process of categorizing participants to minimize the redundancy of the work and the discrepancy of the coding.
   
_Categories_: Python, Excel

**Cloudberry/Big Data Visualization** _(Apr. 2019 – Jun. 2019)_
Python, Excel

1. Implemented the web application to generate the TwitterAPI-referenced data using graph visualization andrestructured the backend and frontend connectivity.
2. Analyzed the underlying algorithm designs and ranked drawbacks and advantages of various data structures.
3. Researched to minimize data representation for efficiency using bundling, clustering, incrementality, and tree cut.
