## WORK EXPERIENCE:

**PhD Software Engineering Intern** _(2025-05 – Present)_

@Google
1. Architected an end-to-end autonomous agent to accelerate debugging by automating the root cause analysis of internal server failures. The agent intelligently triages issues by processing complex performance and reliability logs from large-scale benchmarking systems, significantly reducing manual effort for engineering teams.
2. Engineered a novel LLM-driven engine that transforms unstructured log text into structured, analyzable data. This core component interprets natural language descriptions from engineers to generate regex-based rules on the fly, enabling the agent to precisely detect known failure signatures and identify previously unseen performance bottlenecks.
3. Designed and implemented a scalable Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback system to ensure the agent's continuous evolution. This workflow allows domain experts to validate, refine, and approve the agent's findings on new failures, automatically incorporating them as few-shot learning examples to progressively enhance the model's diagnostic accuracy over time.

@St. Jude Children Research Hospital
1. Developed Single Sign-On project using Agile & Waterfall development cycles and researched Active Directory Federation Service applications for authentication.
2. Implemented idP-initiated SSO with Angular framework as frontend and Node.js as backend server to process SAML assertion from ADFS. Deployed the application on Tomcat to test the Active Directory by using SecureAuth.
3. Optimized the application with MIT-Licensed NPM plugin for SAML 2.0, samlify, to establish connectivity with Active Directory over Node.js.
