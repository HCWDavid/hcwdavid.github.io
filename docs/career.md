<h1>Career</h1>

<p>My professional experience spanning research, teaching, and industry internships.</p>

<div class="career-item">
<h2>PhD Software Engineering Intern</h2>
<p><strong>Google</strong> | Mountain View, CA<br>
<strong>May 2025 - Aug 2025</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Architected an end-to-end autonomous agent to accelerate debugging by automating the root cause analysis of internal server failures. The agent intelligently triages issues by processing complex performance and reliability logs from large-scale benchmarking systems, significantly reducing manual effort for engineering teams.</li>
<li>Engineered a novel LLM-driven engine that transforms unstructured log text into structured, analyzable data. This core component interprets natural language descriptions from engineers to generate regex-based rules on the fly, enabling the agent to precisely detect known failure signatures and identify previously unseen performance bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented a scalable Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback system to ensure the agent's continuous evolution. This workflow allows domain experts to validate, refine, and approve the agent's findings on new failures, automatically incorporating them as few-shot learning examples to progressively enhance the model's diagnostic accuracy over time.</li>
</ul>
