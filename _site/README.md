## **About Me**
I am passionate about advancing the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI), healthcare, and machine learning. My work focuses on leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to improve physical therapy, nursing simulations, and formal verification in AI. Through interdisciplinary collaborations and innovative approaches, I strive to create impactful solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

- Led the development of **PhysiQ**, a framework for continuous tracking and quantitative measurement of off-site exercise activity through passive sensory detection.
- Designed a multi-task spatiotemporal Siamese Neural Network to evaluate both absolute exercise quality through classification and relative quality based on individual progress through similarity comparison.
- Implemented PhysiQ to assess exercises based on three key metrics: range of motion, stability, and repetition.
- Conducted data collection and annotation for 31 participants with varying exercise quality levels, enabling robust evaluation of the framework.
- Demonstrated PhysiQ's effectiveness with a detection accuracy of 89.67% for exercise quality levels and an average R-squared correlation of 0.949 in similarity comparison.
- Highlighted the role of PhysiQ in addressing challenges posed by lack of supervision and self-correction during at-home physical therapy exercises.
