\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{2025--Present}{PhD Software Engineering Intern}{Google}{Mountain View, CA}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Architected an end-to-end autonomous agent to accelerate debugging by automating the root cause analysis of internal server failures. The agent intelligently triages issues by processing complex performance and reliability logs from large-scale benchmarking systems, significantly reducing manual effort for engineering teams.
  \item Engineered a novel LLM-driven engine that transforms unstructured log text into structured, analyzable data. This core component interprets natural language descriptions from engineers to generate regex-based rules on the fly, enabling the agent to precisely detect known failure signatures and identify previously unseen performance bottlenecks.
  \item Designed and implemented a scalable Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback system to ensure the agent's continuous evolution. This workflow allows domain experts to validate, refine, and approve the agent's findings on new failures, automatically incorporating them as few-shot learning examples to progressively enhance the model's diagnostic accuracy over time.

\cventry{2022--Present}{Research Assistant}{Vanderbilt University}{Nashville, TN}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Researched activity recognition using deep learning methodologies, focusing on enhancing the quality assessment of exercises through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques.
  \item Supervised and collaborated with a team of 4-5 undergraduate students on the development of a mobile application, primarily focusing on the application's data visualization and segmentation features, and research on human activity recognition (HAR) techniques.
  \item Worked closely with the team to promote an effective learning environment, fostering innovation and encouraging the application of theoretical concepts in a practical setting.

\cventry{2023--Present}{Teaching Assistant - AI Courses}{Vanderbilt University}{Nashville, TN}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assisted in teaching an intro to AI course and an AI in Cyber Physical System (CPS) course in the fall and spring semesters.
  \item Presented works in human activity recognition (HAR) and SOTA methods, and works that are being utilized.
  \item Graded homework and assignments such as a summary of papers and projects of AI in episodic or sequential environments with fully observable environments.
  \item Hosted at least 2 hours of office hours weekly to offer support to students with homework and understanding of the coursework.
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2021--2022}{Teaching Assistant - Operating Systems}{Vanderbilt University}{Nashville, TN}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assisted in teaching an operating system course, which had approximately 100 students per semester, using the C programming language.
  \item Graded around 11 homework assignments each semester, ensuring a thorough understanding of each student's abilities and offering personalized feedback to enhance their learning experience.
  \item Hosted at least three hours of office hours per week to offer academic support to students, help with homework, and provide clarification on course content.
  \item Refined course slides and materials to better aid students' understanding of operating system concepts and practices.
  \item Conducted surveys and interviews to better understand how to improve course materials and facilitate students' learning experiences.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{2019--2020}{Undergraduate Grader}{University of California, Irvine}{Irvine, CA}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and developed extensive test cases for command-line programs, Bash-like shell, and dynamic memory allocator, and client/server network programming in C.
  \item Collaborated with the professor and a team of 2 graders to design C programming assignments that could be programmatically tested with the auto-grader.
  \item Assisted students 1-on-1 with debugging programs and understanding test case failures.
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2019--2019}{Information Services Intern}{St. Jude Children Research Hospital}{Memphis, TN}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed Single Sign-On project using Agile \& Waterfall development cycles and researched Active Directory Federation Service applications for authentication.
  \item Implemented idP-initiated SSO with Angular framework as frontend and Node.js as backend server to process SAML assertion from ADFS. Deployed the application on Tomcat to test the Active Directory by using SecureAuth.
  \item Optimized the application with MIT-Licensed NPM plugin for SAML 2.0, samlify, to establish connectivity with Active Directory over Node.js.
